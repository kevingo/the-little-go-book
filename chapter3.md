# Chapter 3 - Maps, Arrays and Slices

到目前為止我們看過了一些簡單了型別和結構。現在該是時候來看看陣列、陣列、slices 和 maps 了。

## 陣列

如果你來自 Python，Ruby，Perl，JavaScript 或 PHP（和更多），你可能在寫程式時習慣使用*動態陣列*。
這些陣列是在數據添加到陣列時自行調整大小的陣列。在 Go 中，像許多其他語言一樣，陣列是固定的。
宣告陣列需要我們指定大小，一旦指定大小，它就不能增加：

```go
var scores [10]int
scores[0] = 339
```

上面這個陣列宣告可以透過 `scores[0]` 到 `scores[9]` 來存取 10 個分數值。
如果嘗試存取超過這個範圍的陣列元素，編譯器會拋出執行時期錯誤。

我們也可以在初始化陣列的時候賦值：

```go
scores := [4]int{9001, 9333, 212, 33}
```

我們可以用 `len` 函式來取得陣列的長度。而 `range` 函式可以用來循序的存取每個元素值：

```go
for index, value := range scores {

}
```

使用陣列是有效率但不夠靈活。通常我們不知道即將要處理元素的數量，讓我們來看看 slices。

## Slices

在 Go 中，你很少會直接使用陣列，通常情況下你會使用 slices。slices 是一個輕量級的結構，
這個結構被封裝後，代表了一個陣列的一部份。這裡我們列出一些建立 slices 的方法，並且指出我們會在
後面什麼時候會用到他們。

第一種方式和我們建立陣列時有點相像：

```go
scores := []int{1,4,293,4,9}
```

不同於陣列的宣告，slice 在宣告時不需要宣告長度。為了理解兩者的差異，我們來看看另外一種使用 `make` 
建立 slice 的方式：

```go
scores := make([]int, 10)
```

We use `make` instead of `new` because there's more to creating a slice than 
just allocating the memory (which is what `new` does). Specifically, 
we have to allocate the memory for the underlying array and also initialize 
the slice.  In the above, we initialize a slice with a 
length of 10 and a capacity of 10. The length is the size of the slice, 
the capacity is the size of the underlying array. 
Using `make` we can specify the two separately:
我們使用 `make` 而沒有使用 `new` 是因為建立一個 slice 不僅僅是分配一個記憶體區間而已（`new` 的
作用就是分配一段記憶體區間）。明確的來說，我們幫底層的陣列建立了一段記憶體區間，同時也要初始化 slice。
在上面的例子中，我們初始化一個 slice，長度和容量都是 10。長度代表 slice 的大小，
而容量是底層陣列的大小。

```go
scores := make([]int, 0, 10)
```

This creates a slice with a length of 0 but with a capacity of 10. 
(If you're paying attention, you'll note that `make` and `len` *are* overloaded. 
Go is a language that, to the frustration of some, makes use of features which aren't exposed for developers to use.)

To better understand the interplay between length and capacity, let's look at some examples:

```go
func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 0, 10)
  scores[7] = 9033
  fmt.Println(scores)
}
```

Our first example crashes. Why? Because our slice has a length of 0. Yes, the underlying array has 10 elements, but we need to explicitly expand our slice in order to access those elements. One way to expand a slice is via `append`:

```go
func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 0, 10)
  scores = append(scores, 5)
  fmt.Println(scores) // prints [5]
}
```

But that changes the intent of our original code. Appending to a slice of length 0 will set the first element. For whatever reason, our crashing code wanted to set the element at index 7. To do this, we can re-slice our slice:

```go
func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 0, 10)
  scores = scores[0:8]
  scores[7] = 9033
  fmt.Println(scores)
}
```

How large can we resize a slice? Up to its capacity which, in this case, is 10. You might be thinking *this doesn't actually solve the fixed-length issue of arrays.* It turns out that `append` is pretty special. If the underlying array is full, it will create a new larger array and copy the values over (this is exactly how dynamic arrays work in PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, ...). This is why, in the example above that used `append`, we had to re-assign the value returned by `append` to our `scores` variable: `append` might have created a new value if the original had no more space.

If I told you that Go grew arrays with a 2x algorithm, can you guess what the following will output?

```go
func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 0, 5)
  c := cap(scores)
  fmt.Println(c)

  for i := 0; i < 25; i++ {
    scores = append(scores, i)

    // if our capacity has changed,
    // Go had to grow our array to accommodate the new data
    if cap(scores) != c {
      c = cap(scores)
      fmt.Println(c)
    }
  }
}
```

The initial capacity of `scores` is 5. In order to hold 20 values, it'll have to be expanded 3 times with a capacity of 10, 20 and finally 40.

As a final example, consider:

```go
func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 5)
  scores = append(scores, 9332)
  fmt.Println(scores)
}
```

Here, the output is going to be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9332]`. Maybe you thought it would be `[9332, 0, 0, 0, 0]`? To a human, that might seem logical. To a compiler, you're telling it to append a value to a slice that already holds 5 values.

Ultimately, there are four common ways to initialize a slice:

```go
names := []string{"leto", "jessica", "paul"}
checks := make([]bool, 10)
var names []string
scores := make([]int, 0, 20)
```

When do you use which? The first one shouldn't need much of an explanation. You use this when you know the values that you want in the array ahead of time.

The second one is useful when you'll be writing into specific indexes of a slice. For example:

```go
func extractPowers(saiyans []*Saiyans) []int {
  powers := make([]int, len(saiyans))
  for index, saiyan := range saiyans {
    powers[index] = saiyan.Power
  }
  return powers
}
```

The third version is a nil slice and is used in conjunction with `append`, when the number of elements is unknown.

The last version lets us specify an initial capacity; useful if we have a general idea of how many elements we'll need.

Even when you know the size, `append` can be used. It's largely a matter of preference:

```go
func extractPowers(saiyans []*Saiyans) []int {
  powers := make([]int, 0, len(saiyans))
  for _, saiyan := range saiyans {
    powers = append(powers, saiyan.Power)
  }
  return powers
}
```

Slices as wrappers to arrays is a powerful concept. Many languages have the concept of slicing an array. Both JavaScript and Ruby arrays have a `slice` method. You can also get a slice in Ruby by using `[START..END]` or in Python via `[START:END]`. However, in these languages, a slice is actually a new array with the values of the original copied over. If we take Ruby, what's the output of the following?

```go
scores = [1,2,3,4,5]
slice = scores[2..4]
slice[0] = 999
puts scores
```

The answer is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. That's because `slice` is a completely new array with copies of values. Now, consider the Go equivalent:

```go
scores := []int{1,2,3,4,5}
slice := scores[2:4]
slice[0] = 999
fmt.Println(scores)
```

The output is `[1, 2, 999, 4, 5]`.

This changes how you code. For example, a number of functions take a position parameter. In JavaScript, if we want to find the first space in a string (yes, slices work on strings too!) after the first five characters, we'd write:

```go
haystack = "the spice must flow";
console.log(haystack.indexOf(" ", 5));
```

In Go, we leverage slices:

```go
strings.Index(haystack[5:], " ")
```

We can see from the above example, that `[X:]` is shorthand for *from X to the end* while `[:X]` is shorthand for *from the start to X*. Unlike other languages, Go doesn't support negative values. If we want all of the values of a slice except the last, we do:

```go
scores := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
scores = scores[:len(scores)-1]
```

The above is the start of an efficient way to remove a value from an unsorted slice:

```go
func main() {
  scores := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  scores = removeAtIndex(scores, 2)
  fmt.Println(scores)
}

func removeAtIndex(source []int, index int) []int {
  lastIndex := len(source) - 1
  //swap the last value and the value we want to remove
  source[index], source[lastIndex] = source[lastIndex], source[index]
  return source[:lastIndex]
}
```

Finally, now that we know about slices, we can look at another commonly used built-in function: `copy`. `copy` is one of those functions that highlights how slices change the way we code. Normally, a method that copies values from one array to another has 5 parameters: `source`, `sourceStart`, `count`, `destination` and `destinationStart`. With slices, we only need two:

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "math/rand"
  "sort"
)

func main() {
  scores := make([]int, 100)
  for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
    scores[i] = int(rand.Int31n(1000))
  }
  sort.Ints(scores)

  worst := make([]int, 5)
  copy(worst, scores[:5])
  fmt.Println(worst)
}
```

Take some time and play with the above code. Try variations. See what happens if you change copy to something like `copy(worst[2:4], scores[:5])`, or what if you try to copy more or less than `5` values into `worst`?

## Maps

Maps in Go are what other languages call hashtables or dictionaries. They work as you expect: you define a key and value, and can get, set and delete values from it.

Maps, like slices, are created with the `make` function. Let's look at an example:

```go
func main() {
  lookup := make(map[string]int)
  lookup["goku"] = 9001
  power, exists := lookup["vegeta"]

  // prints 0, false
  // 0 is the default value for an integer
  fmt.Println(power, exists)
}
```

To get the number of keys, we use `len`. To remove a value based on its key, we use `delete`:

```go
// returns 1
total := len(lookup)

// has no return, can be called on a non-existing key
delete(lookup, "goku")
```

Maps grow dynamically. However, we can supply a second argument to `make` to set an initial size:

```go
lookup := make(map[string]int, 100)
```

If you have some idea of how many keys your map will have, defining an initial size can help with performance.

When you need a map as a field of a structure, you define it as:

```go
type Saiyan struct {
  Name string
  Friends map[string]*Saiyan
}
```

One way to initialize the above is via:

```go
goku := &Saiyan{
  Name: "Goku",
  Friends: make(map[string]*Saiyan),
}
goku.Friends["krillin"] = ... //todo load or create Krillin
```

There's yet another way to declare and initialize values in Go. Like `make`, this approach is specific to maps and arrays. We can declare as a composite literal:

```go
lookup := map[string]int{
  "goku": 9001,
  "gohan": 2044,
}
```

We can iterate over a map using a `for` loop combined with the `range` keyword:

```go
for key, value := range lookup {
  ...
}
```

Iteration over maps isn't ordered. Each iteration over a lookup will return the key value pair in a random order.

## Pointers versus Values

We finished Chapter 2 by looking at whether you should assign and pass pointers or values. We'll now have this same conversation with respect to array and map values. Which of these should you use?

```go
a := make([]Saiyan, 10)
//or
b := make([]*Saiyan, 10)
```

Many developers think that passing `b` to, or returning it from, a function is going to be more efficient. However, what's being passed/returned is a copy of the slice, which itself is a reference. So with respect to passing/returning the slice itself, there's no difference.

Where you will see a difference is when you modify the values of a slice or map. At this point, the same logic that we saw in Chapter 2 applies. So the decision on whether to define an array of pointers versus an array of values comes down to how you use the individual values, not how you use the array or map itself.

## Before You Continue

Arrays and maps in Go work much like they do in other languages. If you're used to dynamic arrays, there might be a small adjustment, but `append` should solve most of your discomfort. If we peek beyond the superficial syntax of arrays, we find slices. Slices are powerful and they have a surprisingly large impact on the clarity of your code.

There are edge cases that we haven't covered, but you're not likely to run into them. And, if you do, hopefully the foundation we've built here will let you understand what's going on.
